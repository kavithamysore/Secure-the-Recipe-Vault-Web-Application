Two poor security practices in the given design are:

1. S3 buckets are publicly accessible:
Publicly accessible S3 buckets allow malicious users to access sensitive data inside S3 buckets which can lead to misuse of the data.
Unless explicitly required anyone on the internet to be able to read or write to S3 bucket, we should ensure that your S3 bucket is not public.


2. S3 buckets have server side encryption disabled:
Server-side encryption can help reduce risk to data by encrypting the data with a key that is stored in a different mechanism than the mechanism that stores the data itself.
Having server side encryption disabled will pose the risk of data being misused in the event the application instance primary key is compromised.
