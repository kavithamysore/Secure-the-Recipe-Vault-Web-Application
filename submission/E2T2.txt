Following are the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.

1. securityhub-s3-bucket-server-side-encryption-enabled-5ccf2f06 - Non Compliant
2. securityhub-s3-bucket-level-public-access-prohibited-bc01393c - Non Compliant
3. securityhub-s3-lifecycle-policy-check-25806657 - Non Compliant
4. securityhub-s3-account-level-public-access-blocks-periodic-e511f49f  - Non Comppliant
5. Security groups should not allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 22
6. Ensure no security groups allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 3389
7. The VPC default security group should not allow inbound and outbound traffic
8. VPC flow logging should be enabled in all VPCs

The way to remediate these vulnerabilities are by following the below steps
1. Disabling public access to s3 bucket
2. Enable server side encryption on s3 buckets
3. Restrict access to S3 by bucket enforcing Least Privileged access IAM Policy
4. Restrict ssh access to application instance via port 22 by allowing only access from load balance via port 5000
5. Configure all VPC default security groups to restrict all traffic will encourage least privilege security group development and mindful placement of AWS resources into security groups which will in-turn reduce the exposure of those resources.
