a. Scan infrastructure as code templates: Regula
	Identifying overly permissive IAM policy is an example compliance violoation which Regula can expose.

b. Scan AMIâ€™s or containers for OS vulnerabilities: Aquasec
    Aquasec can scan Container Images for Vulnerabilities and expose advanced threats like Hidden Malware which static scanning cannot spot.

c. Scan an AWS environment for cloud configuration vulnerabilities: Fugue
    Fugue scans the cloud infrastructure in a Penvironment and identifies compliance violations according to the compliance families we choose.
    You may optionally set a baseline and Fugue will detect when resources drift from that baseline.
    You can also choose to enable enforcement(AWS & AWS GovCloud), and Fugue will remediate drift, automatically reverting changes and returning infrastructure back to the known-good state of your baseline.
